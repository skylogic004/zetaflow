# Zeta Flow
Welcome, this is the source code for the Flash game "Zeta Flow" hosted on zetaflow.skylogic.ca

I'm putting put up the source code here for the purpose of archiving and for those that are interested in learning how Zeta Flow was made. Since FlashPlayer is officially unsupported, I'm hoping that by uploading ZF here that maybe it can still live on, at least in our hearts if nowhere else.

**NOTE: I just started uploading things. I have not yet tested whether stuff is working. Also, the swf will only run within skylogic.ca, I'll probably change that later to allow it to run locally on people's computers...if that helps make it playable after Flash is dead...**
