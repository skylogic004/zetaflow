# Zeta Flow
Welcome, this is the source code for the Flash game "Zeta Flow" hosted on https://zetaflow.skylogic.ca

I'm putting put up the source code here for the purpose of archiving and for those that are interested in learning how Zeta Flow was made. Since Flash Player is officially unsupported, I'm hoping that by uploading ZF here that maybe it can still live on, at least in our hearts if nowhere else.

# Developers
To compile the source code, you need to open the `*.fla` file in Macromedia Flash MX (version 6) IDE and click File > Publish.

Zeta Flow's user-created levels and level editor (saving/loading levels) rely on there being a PHP webserver and database (MySQL).
Since I haven't released those files yet, you will only be able to use these features at https://zetaflow.skylogic.ca
