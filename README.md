# Zeta Flow
Welcome, this is the source code for the Flash game "Zeta Flow" hosted on zetaflow.skylogic.ca

I'm putting put up the source code here for the purpose of archiving and for those that are interested in learning how Zeta Flow was made. Since Flash is dead, I'm hoping that by uploading ZF here that maybe it can still live on, at least in our hearts if nowhere else.

**NOTE: I just started uploading things. I have not yet tested whether stuff is working. Also, the swf will only run within skylogic.ca, I'll probably change that later to allow it to run locally on people's computers...if that helps make it playable after Flash is dead (I'll look into whether that's an option after Adobe pulls the plug)**

# Flash Player plugin
On 2020-12-13 I downloaded the Flash Player plugin from Adobe's website. Since they won't be offering it anymore, I thought it might be helpful to have the installer available here. (see `flash_player_as_of_2020-12-13`)
